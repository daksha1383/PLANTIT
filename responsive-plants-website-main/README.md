## Inspiration of the Project:
The project is inspired by the rising environmental crisis, and the need for innovating and aspiring technology to increase our chances of survival. Each and everyone of us is responsible for this change, and so do we hold responsibility to make a positive impact. The easiest way to make change is through planting, yet most of us are afraid to take a step fearing our inability to care for the plants. This problem has been identified and evaluated into a solution. Another anchor in the field of agriculture is the underrepresentation of women, we seek to explore opportunities where women are provided with a platform that enables them to showcase their expertise in agriculture.

## What it does
The project is a website and a UI/UX design for an application, the product enables a user to keep track of their plants based on the species, nutrient requirements, scheduled watering hours, using an internal counter that relays notifications on a timely basis to support the users.. The application also has a built-in store that provides suggestions for nutrients and other forms of agriculture products sold exclusively by women run organizations. To maximize impact and reach, we have included support for multiple languages on the website.


## How we built it
The website will be built on Visual Studio Code, using JavaScript and HTML5 as the primary languages, while using CSS as the framework mechanism. A HTML skeleton has been used to build the website. The UI design will be created using the Uizard platform. Media and images will be extracted from google to be used.


## What we learned
We learned that hackathons work in groups to enable interactions and to share professionalism. Most IT/CS positions involve the process of thought provoking and distribution of workload that fosters efficiency.
